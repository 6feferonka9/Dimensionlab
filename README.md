# DimensionaLab Frontend Engineering Challenge

I have added linters I use in projects: eslint-config-airbnb-typescript, eslint-plugin-react.
I also usually use linters that force functional programming but I have decided not to in this project
because of possible conflicts with other libraries that would take time to fix.

I use styled-components for styling.

I have decided to use Recoil for state because I am more familiar with it to save time at this project
altho Zustand is supported out of the box.

I need to go deeper into the docs especially react-three-fiber and Three.js because its pretty complex but really fun to do.

We can talk about my code design and decisions on a call. There is some room for improvements that I did not have time for.
How I write my code: I try to make some proof of concept, working code and that way I learn how it will work, how to 
structure it and more. Then I rewrite it in a more efficient and better way.
